= Mirah Plugin for Gradle


[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
  id 'org.mirag.lang' version '0.9'
}

dependencies {
    compile 'org.mirah:mirah:0.1.4' // <1>
}
----
<1> Define the version of Mirah to be used for compilation

Now put your sources in `src/main/mirah` or `src/test/mirah`

Two tasks (of type `MirahCompile` are automatically added when the plugin is applied. They are called `compileMirah` and
`compileTestMirah`.

== Compatibility

* Gradle 2.0 - 2.12
* JDK 1.7+

== The future

* `MirahDoc` task type, when there is a way to build source docs.
* Clean stale class files if it is deemed to be an issue.
* Incremental compilation (when supported by Mirah).
* Joint compilation (when supported by Mirah).
